As a university student, I want to set due dates of to-do items so that I can complete tasks on time.

To remind myself, I want to set to-do list in different colors, styles and fonts.
To make my to-do list clear, I hope to mark level of importance of each events.
If the app can mute my phone while doing things in a particular time that will be great.
I hope the app warn me when a work hasn't been done for a long time.
I would like to share my to-do list with others and see other's public to-do list.
