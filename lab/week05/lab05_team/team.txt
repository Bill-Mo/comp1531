In my opinion, the biggest challenges is that different group members work in different paces. This will lead to inefficient meetings, since we might discuss something that some members haven't gone through. Besides, we cannot test some functions without other functions.

I hope to learn how to be a leader to manage group work more efficient. Currently I am not a leader of our gourp, and we assigned works according to workloads, which might not be the best way of work allocation. If there is a way to allocate works to people who is good at it, we can finish our work more efficient and perfect.
