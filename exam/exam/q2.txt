Yes, it should be considered memory safe. Because this means Java would not allow you to access memory that is out of size bound of array a when calling a. For example, accessing a[10] when your array a is dedined that length of array a is less than 11 is not allowed. Other methods to approach sofeware safety are ckecking memory leak while allocating memory, ensuring data type safety and so on.
