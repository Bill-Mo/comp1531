This is an accidental compexity. Because a lot of things the programmer did that makes the code complex is not inherent. For example, writing own date parsing class is unecessary since there is probably a methods in time library doing that things. Similarly, there is probably a methods in time library doing the mathematics to figure out how many seconds it's been since Jan 1 1500 AD.
